# bingo-domain-generator

I want to build a bingo card generator for "domain name bingo". The bingo card should display prominently (5x5 grid) with a button under that says "Generate Card" that makes a new bingo card with a random assortment of values from a list

the "free" space will always be "Hand register a domain"

The other options are:
Win a domain auction as the only bidder
Purchase an expired domain
Win a domain auction with competing bids
Earn money from a parked domain
Sell a domain through a marketplace
Sell a domain through a broker
Sell a domain directly
Lease a domain you own
Own 100 domains
Own 1000 domains
Get an unsolicited offer for a domain
Participate in a UDRP claim
Own a ngTLD ("new gTLD")
Own a ccTLD
Let a domain expire
Go 30 days with no new domains
Own 3 of the same SLD domains with different TLDs
Own a dictionary word .com
Purchase a lot of multiple domains
Sell a domain for 5 figures or more
Backorder a domain successfully
Own a domain for 10 years
Attend namescon (or another industry conference)
Create a personal domain website
